# Collisionatron
A simple collider manager which does simple (not perfect) collisions between non-rotating cubes.  The collisions are *purposely* NOT OPTMISED - no octrees etc. The idea is to generate a large amount of work.   These are calculated using one of three methods: CPU single threaded, CPU multi threaded, GPU using Compute Shaders
